* About
This is my attempt at dealing with the sprawl of dotfiles
* How's it work
dotfiles applies a series of profiles to your $HOME directory.

Each profile requiers two directories:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
files
data
#+END_EXAMPLE

Entries in ~files~ are symlinked to your ~$HOME~ directory,
replacing anything previously there.

Entries in ~data~ have their extension checked to see if it is
~tar.gz~ or ~tar.gz.gpg~.  If it is ~tar.gz~, it is decompressed
with the working directory set to ~$HOME~.  If it is ~tar.gz.gpg~,
the same action is applied but run through gpg.
* How to use it
=dotfiles -p /path/to/profiles/dir profile1 profile2 ... profilen=

Note: the absolute path is required for symlinks to work properly.

Where ~/path/to/profiles/dir~ should look like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
profile1/files
profile1/data
profile2/files
profile2/data
...
profilen/files
profilen/data
#+END_EXAMPLE
